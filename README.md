# Data Science @ BloomTech - Unit 4
## 4.2: Neural Networks

This repository serves to store and document my completed projects, assignments, and learning materials from the BloomTech Data Science curriculum. Unit 4.2 focuses on a broad introduction to Neural Networks and is composed of the following:

### 1: Architect
  * Major Topics: Neural Network Foundational Components, Keras Sequential Model API
  * Trained Simple Feed Forward Neural Network to classify MNIST dataset
  * Experimented with dense layers, activation functions, and optimizers on QuickDraw dataset

### 2: Train
  * Major Topics: Back Propagation, Gradient Descent, Loss Functions
  * Visualized effects of low to high learning rates and batch sizes and implemented learning-rate scheduler CallBack
  * Compared effects of normalized data, batch size, learning rate, and optimizers on training QuickDraw dataset

### 3: Tune
  * Major Topics: Hyperparameter Tuning, Experiment Tracking Frameworks
  * Used Tensorboard to logg and analyze training/validation results of hyperparameter grid search
  * Implemented bayesian-optimized hyperparameter search with Keras Tuner

### 4: Deploy
  * Major Topics: Regularization Strategies, Callbacks, Saving Models
  * Applied EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint Callbacks, and L1/L2  and MaxNorm regularization strategies to Fashion MNIST dataset
  * Visualized weight distributions between initial GlorotUniform, L1/L2 regularized, MaxNorm, and dropout
  * Deployed interactive sketchpad application using Gradio & trained MNIST model to predict hand-drawn numbers 
  

Module Projects, Relevant Datasets, Guided Projects, and Warm-up activities for this unit are located in each module's respective folder.
