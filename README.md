# Data Science @ BloomTech - Unit 4
## 4.2: Neural Networks

This repository serves to store and document my completed projects, assignments, and learning materials from the BloomTech Data Science curriculum. Unit 4.2 focuses on a broad introduction to Neural Networks and is composed of the following:

### 1: Architect
  * Major Topics: Neural Network Foundational Components, Keras Sequential Model API
  * Trained Simple Feed Forward Neural Network to classify MNIST dataset
  * Experimented with dense layers, activation functions, and optimizers on QuickDraw dataset

### 2: Train

### 3: Tune


### 4: Deploy



Module Projects, Relevant Datasets, Guided Projects, and Warm-up activities for this unit are located in each module's respective folder.
